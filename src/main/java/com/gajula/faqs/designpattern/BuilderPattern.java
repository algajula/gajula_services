/*The builder pattern was introduced to solve some of the problems with factory 
and abstract Factory design patterns when the object contains a lot of attributes. 
This pattern solves the issue with a large number of optional parameters 
and inconsistent state by providing a way to build the object step-by-step and 
provide a method that will actually return the final Object.*/
