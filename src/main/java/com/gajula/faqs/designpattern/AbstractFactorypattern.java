/*The abstract factory pattern is similar to the factory pattern and is a factory of factories. 
 * If you are familiar with the factory design pattern in Java, you will notice 
 * that we have a single factory class that returns the different 
 * subclasses based on the input provided and the factory class uses if-else or 
 * switch statements to achieve this. In the abstract factory pattern, 
 * we get rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each subclass and 
 * then an abstract factory class that will return the subclass based on the input factory class.*/
